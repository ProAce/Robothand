# Robothand

This is the coming together of a project that has been lying on the shelf for 5 years. When a buddy and I had to do a school project to graduate we decided to build a robothand that would wirelessly mimic our own hand movement. This made to be a bit of a far stretch for two inexperienced 16 year olds, but we got pretty far. After deciding that the flex sensors we wanted to use where too expensive (10â‚¬ a piece) we found a way to make them ourselves. Eventually we couldn't get it too work wirelessly, but it did work wired... kinda.

Now I figured this was something that had to be finished, and with a little more budget and knowledge this time it is coming together quite nicely.

For testing purposes I used a arduino nano I had lying around as a I2C ADC for the ESP8266 board. The hardware design in this repository utilises an ADC128D818 unit which you could order assembled from services like JLCPCB but is also solderable by hand.
