# Robothand

This is the coming together of a project that has been lying on the shelf for 5 years. When a buddy and I had to do a school project to graduate we decided to build a robothand that would wirelessly mimic our own hand movement. This made to be a bit of a far stretch for two inexperienced 16 year olds, but we got pretty far. After deciding that the flex sensors we wanted to use where too expensive (10â‚¬ a piece) we found a way to make them ourselves. Eventually we couldn't get it too work wirelessly, but it did work wired... kinda.

Now I figured this was something that had to be finished, and with a little more budget and knowledge this time it is coming together quite nicely.
